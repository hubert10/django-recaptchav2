# Django Recaptcha V2 

This simple project (Python + Django) aims at explaining how to configure Django apps with Google Recaptcha v2 to not let lobots post on django forms.

This project is based on https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/

Everything is taken from that tutorial.
